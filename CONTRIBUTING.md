#### What I'm looking for:
* Actual C++ devs!
    * I have no idea what I'm doing.
    * I particularly have almost no idea how to properly use cmake or any of the "build system"-y things.
    * Especially helpful would be someone to tell me if there is an easier way to make use of osquery tables
    that isn't compiling them into dashiell.
* Javascript devs
    * More hands and eyes never hurts - particularly around web design, for which I have no eye.
* Ideas
    * I have a general idea of where I'll be going, but I'm open to suggestions.
